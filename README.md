# Requirements

🎯 Implement responsive design using media queries to ensure the website works well on both small mobile screens and larger desktop screens (e.g., above 800px).
🎯 Ensure all images have appropriate alt text attributes for accessibility.
🎯 Correctly use event handlers to switch images based on user interactions.

## Results

- I implemented a responsive design that works well on desktop, mobile and tablets by using media queries, flexbox and grid.
- All images have their respective alt text
- Using event handlers I was able to make the images clickable, and I added right and left buttons for navigation as well

# Some stretch goals

🏹 Use ‘srcset’ to specify which image will be used based on the size of the screen for optimal viewing experience.
🏹 Add ARIA elements to improve accessibility, such as aria-label, aria-live, and other relevant attributes.
🏹 Implement key bindings for buttons to enhance navigation, such as using arrow keys to switch between images.
🏹 Develop media queries for multiple screen sizes.

## Stretch goals results

- I used scrset to display smaller images on smaller screens
- I used aria labels and aria-live
- I added tab functionality to the images inside the thumbnail container to enhance navigation
- I added several on over effects to enhance User experience
- I added a button that changes on click (from arrow up to down and vice versa) and hides and unhides the thumbnail container so that is not in the way.
- I added a favicon
- I added Fontawesome icons

# I tried but could not achieve/would like help with

- I would like to know how to transition between images smoothly
- How to highlight selected images (more comments on this in the app.js)
- How to make images scroll into view as we move through the gallery (more comments on this in the app.js)
